This is my Diffusion code, each language has it's own separate README file with instructions on how to run the program. 
The goal of this project is to get the simulated time it would take for a gas to completely diffuse into a room that is the shape
of a perfect cube. Additionally, these programs can test and retrieve the time it takes to diffuse the gas if there is a wall
in the middle of the room.
